# Machine Learning Model Report
===================================

### Model: Neural Network
**MAE:** 13.913414480933755  
**RMSE:** 22.51878922818194  
**R²:** 0.9991854612257548  

The Neural Network model achieved extremely high performance on this dataset with very low errors and an almost perfect R². This suggests that the network is capturing the underlying patterns very well. However, such high performance might indicate potential overfitting, so further validation on external data or with cross-validation is recommended.  

-----------------------------------

### Model: XGBoost
**MAE:** 23.21895060348894  
**RMSE:** 80.27928287351098  
**R²:** 0.9896478952143806  

XGBoost performs very well with an excellent R² and reasonably low MAE. The RMSE is higher compared to the Neural Network, suggesting that while most predictions are accurate, there may be some outlier predictions contributing to larger errors. This model is robust and benefits from hyperparameter tuning, but might require further adjustments to reduce the effect of high-error cases.  

-----------------------------------

### Model: Ensemble Model
**MAE:** 13.813102202862312  
**RMSE:** 36.90748893772037  
**R²:** 0.9978119830239982  

The ensemble model, which averages predictions from the Neural Network and XGBoost, achieves performance nearly matching the Neural Network in terms of MAE and R². The RMSE is slightly higher than the Neural Network alone, indicating that while the ensemble approach reduces overall bias, it may introduce some variance due to the combination. Overall, the ensemble leverages the strengths of both models and shows very high reliability.  

-----------------------------------

### Overall Observations:
1. The dataset, likely containing hyperspectral data, seems to be well-suited for both deep learning and tree-based models.  
2. The Neural Network's near-perfect R² suggests excellent model fit, but caution should be taken regarding overfitting.  
3. XGBoost demonstrates robustness and reliability, particularly when combined in an ensemble, which helps balance the models’ individual strengths and weaknesses.  
4. The ensemble approach is promising as it provides stable performance across multiple evaluation metrics.
